      <p>Happy Birthday Sthandwa Sami. Damn, I don't know what to say but okay... here goes nothing. I can't believe this is your third birthday<br>
      with me. Wait... I don't think that makes sense, but you get what I mean, right?? We started dating when you were  18 and now you're 21?? Where did<br>
    time go?</p>
<br></br>
      <p>Firstly, I'm  super proud of you. You're doing so well for yourself in all spheres. You've grown so much not so long ago you were just a lousy teenager<br>
      now you're growing into a young gentleman. Well, I'm happy I got to witness that transition. 21 sounds like big number doesn't it, I mean you're reaching your unc status now.<br>
      I hope 21 bring you <strong>joy, fun, abundance</strong><strong> and many blessings.</strong> God has kept you for 21 years, I hope he triples these 21 years and hopefully<br>
    I'll still be in your life.</p>
<br></br>
      <p>My love, I just want to remind you how much you mean to me and how deeply grateful I am to have you. Life put us through trials and tribulation, but we're still<br>
      here tryna figure out life together. I never imagined that I'd be lucky enough to share my life with you. Being with you has taught me so much about myself,<br>
    love and life. I've learnt to appreciate the little moments that go by unnoticed, whether it's your cheesy jokes or when you hold me when words weren't enough.<br>
  Even the most ordinary days become extraordinary when I spend them with you, your presence alone is enough to turn the dull to extraordinary.</p>
<br></br>
      <p>As you celebrate another year ngifuna wazi ukuthi I'm celebrating the amazing person you are (to others, you're awful to me and you know that), you're the best (sometimes) part of my<br>
      life and I absolutely couldn't be more grateful. While I'm still bench warming for the right person that you're looking for I'll cherish every moment<br>
    even though they are terrible but hey I'll cherish it. Uhm, can't wait to see what the future holds for us ig. I hope you're the person I'll spend the rest of my life with. Well if you're
  a better person.</p>
<br></br>
  <p>
    I wish you nothing but pure happiness, love and fulfillment of all your dreams, you deserve everything good this world has to offer. If I could, I'd do so much more to make your<br>
   day memorable. Well, you're getting your gifts when I see you. But, one day I'll do so much more for you.<br> Thank you for being the stranger that walked in my life and changed it for the better, 
   although you put me through hell 98% of the time. <br>
   Inhliziyo eyami eyakho and that'll never change. Ngisho noma ukuthi awusafuni ukuba nami. Ngiyakuthanda kakhulu, I hope you know and see that. I love yu endlessly. Have a great day.
